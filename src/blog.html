                <p class="myblog-paragraghe"> <em> The beginning.</em>
                    All started a while ago, after moving from France to Dublin to Learn English. I then endeavored a new path
                    as a Fraud and Credit Analyst at PayPal .
                    Back then, I had everything to learn:  fraud trends, risk assessment, financial analysis,  exposure,
                    risky industries. A whole new world opened to me and I loved it. I would call and ask merchants and
                    fraudsters questions about their business, business model…etc. At the beginning calling was so
                    intimidating, whether it was a French, English Speaker or Spanish merchants.
                    As the time went by, everything became easier and I was flying at my job. Then came Covid 19, Work
                    From Home became the new trend. A new work-life balance was to be set and discovered, and I was lucky enough to be
                    able to travel and work from home in France and Dublin, back and forth.

            <div class="myblog-card-paragraghe">
                <p class="myblog-paragraghe"> <em> How it all started.</em>
                    During covid, a life changing questioning about my goals and dreams kept
                    hitting my brain quiet often. While I loved my life in Ireland, it became clear that I was
                    missing being with my family and spending time with them. The pandemic set a new perspective
                    on life and choices we made. What was obvious at the time, wasn't anymore. Change was knocking
                    at my door and crying out loud to be taken seriously. I then started to look for what I would
                    like to do and to be . Somehow I forgot that I started to build my own blog/website with html and css few years back.
                    This one was never deployed, but I remembered loving the process of building and searching.
                    It hit home and I started to look for courses and I found two courses that were perfect for me.

                <p class="myblog-paragraghe"> <em> My goals and dreams.</em>
                    Finally, September 2021 comes and I start my new journey to become a web and mobile developer with
                    General Assembly London first, (3 months Immersive bootcamp) then L’Idem, Creative digital art
                    school in France. A whole year learning and grinding code, methods, syntax, API, documentation.
                    Flying from html to css and Javascript. Dancing with API rest and databases, Json and SQL, JWT and
                    secure Oauth2, Django and MongoDB…my head kept spinning during this all time, wondering why did I
                    choose this career path, then building back the courage to go further and learn some more, build
                    some more. All this journey would not have been possible without the dedicated instructors and
                    staff, the students I met along the way. A network of different backgrounds and age, all with a
                    same goal.
